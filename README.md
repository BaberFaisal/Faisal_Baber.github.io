This is the project repo of my personal portfolio site [Faisal_Baber.github.io](https://Faisal_Baber.github.io/). Projects related to data analysis are uploaded here to showcase as part of my portfolio. 

This is a GitHub Pages site using Jekyll. Jekyll action workflow is used to deploy the GitHub Pages on git push.
